This app provides an endpoints for adding/removing/updating/view of the users, products and orders.

The schema is provided in the schema.sql and also the dummy data in export.sql. When running the app for the first time,
please update the database properties of local postgres server in app.py

When the app runs, if there is any error while running the orders table, schema will be run and tables are created from scratch
The reason is as orders table is closely tied with the other two tables, we can create the tables based on how orders table responds

Also the schemas can be prior created from export.sql before running the schema.sql, I am just attaching both the files
but technically any one can perform the job

The below routes are available
            1. users - GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/users
            2. products - GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/products
            3. orders - GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/products
